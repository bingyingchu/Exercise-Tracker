It is built with the MERN stack, React for the front-end UI, a REST API written with Node and Express for theback-end web service, and MongoDB for database persistence.

The data is stored in MongoDB in a collection named exercises. Each document in the collection has the following properties (i.e., all properties are required): name, reps, weight, unit and date.
